**Relevance:** SOLE evidence of what occurred in dismissal meeting

## Evidence Quality Assessment

### Strongest Evidence
1. **File 09 (Forged Resignation)** - Chronologically impossible; proves bad faith
2. **File 03 (Meeting Minutes)** - Only documented record; proves ASDA circumvented Code
3. **File 02 (Custody Order)** - Legal proof of impossibility
4. **File 07 (Grievance Rejection)** - Same-day rejection proves sham process
5. **File 14 (Final Payslip)** - Proves unlawful deduction

### Supporting Evidence

- **ASDA's forged resignation** (File 09) proves consciousness of guilt and bad faith
- **Shelley Appleby location reversal** proves discrimination despite restructuring claims
