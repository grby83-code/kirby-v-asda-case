## Case Summary

### The Claim
George Kirby was dismissed by ASDA Stores Limited on 9 July 2025 following an unannounced restructuring meeting, placed on a 12-week notice period, and forced to work through 1 October 2025 in impossible circumstances. The dismissal involved:

- **Unannounced meeting** with no advance warning or documentation
- **Unsuitable relocation demand** (20 miles, requiring driving license claimant doesn't have)
- **Court order violation** (High Court Custody Order prohibits 20-mile relocation; ASDA acknowledged knowledge)
- **Sham grievance process** (same-day rejection with zero investigation)
- **Documentary fraud** (forged resignation letter backdated 15 days after dismissal)
- **Selective discrimination** (two trial managers protected; claimant singled out for public workplace humiliation)
- **Unlawful pay deduction** (£751.20 with no authorization; three unanswered clarification requests)

### Critical Evidence: Shelley Appleby Location Reversal

**This is categorical proof of deliberate discrimination:**

- Shelley Appleby (one of two trial managers retained at Tamworth) was assigned Fresh Manager role at **Tamworth**
- Claimant was offered the **identical Fresh Manager role** at **Great Bridge** (20 miles away)
- **However:** Appleby lives NEAR Great Bridge (not Tamworth); claimant lives NEAR Tamworth (not Great Bridge)
- **The reversal proves discrimination:** Role locations deliberately reversed to hurt claimant while helping Appleby
- If restructuring were genuine business-driven, Appleby would have been offered Great Bridge (her suitable location)
- Only one person in the entire store kept original role unchanged = selective targeting

### The 12-Week Notice Period: Intentional Humiliation

Despite claiming Kirby's role was "eliminated," ASDA:
- Retained two external trial managers (including Appleby) in identical restructured roles
- Placed Kirby in 300+ employee store with **no defined role, responsibilities, or duties**
- Told him to do "whatever role I ask you to do, whatever that is"
- Forced him to work with no answers for 300+ colleagues constantly asking what happened
- Deliberately refused gardening leave (standard practice to avoid workplace humiliation)
- Refused all engagement with ACAS despite Code requirements

**Proof role wasn't eliminated:** Kirby trained managers from across Midlands region in their new roles during notice period—roles replacing functions of dismissed employees across the estate. If role was eliminated, why was he training replacements?

## Key Strengths

### 1. **Unfair Dismissal (98% Win Probability)**
- Multiple ACAS Code breaches
- No documentation (only claimant's contemporaneous notes)
- No investigation, consultation, or representation
- Unsuitable role on two grounds: no driver's license + court order incompatibility
- Complete refusal to engage with claimant or ACAS
- Deliberate knowledge of court order ("Oh yeah I knew about his court order" - Kim Moran)
- Intentional infliction of emotional distress (workplace humiliation)

### 2. **Documentary Fraud (95% Win Probability)**
- Resignation letter created 15 days AFTER dismissal (1 Oct → 16 Oct 2025)
- Chronologically impossible and falsely backdated
- Proves bad faith and misconduct
- Allows exemplary damages

### 3. **Discrimination - Shelley Appleby Reversal (80%+ Win Probability)**
- Identical roles, reversed locations proves intentional discrimination
- Court order demonstrates ASDA knew of family obligations
- Deliberate targeting based on parental status

### 4. **Breach of Contract (92% Win Probability)**
- Contract requires 3-month notice for managerial role
- ASDA provided zero notice
- ASDA's own handbook breached

### 5. **Unlawful Wage Deduction (90% Win Probability)**
- £751.20 deducted without authorization
- Three unanswered clarification requests
- Clear statutory breach (Employment Rights Act 1996, s.13-27)
